## üîß Key Concepts and Techniques

### **1. Data Collection and Preprocessing**
- Gathered financial data from diverse sources.
- Cleaned, transformed, and normalized datasets to prepare them for analysis.
- Extracted and engineered features to improve prediction accuracy.

### **2. Machine Learning Approaches**
- **Linear Regression**: Predicted price trends and stock returns.
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: Used for pattern recognition in historical stock data.
- **Regression Trees**: Built decision models to identify profitable trades.
- **Q-Learning**: Developed reinforcement learning agents to optimize game outcomes.

### **3. Backtesting and Evaluation**
- Implemented backtesting frameworks to simulate historical performance.
- Analyzed strategy performance using metrics such as Sharpe ratio and drawdown.
- Iteratively refined models and strategies for improved profitability and reduced risk.
